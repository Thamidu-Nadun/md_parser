# ðŸ¦¶ Footnotes

Easily add footnotes to your text to provide additional information or citations without cluttering the main body.

## Usage

Define a footnote using `[^name]` and then provide the content for it elsewhere in the document.

```markdown
Here is some text with a footnote[^1].

And here is another one[^another].

[^1]: This is the content of the first footnote.
[^another]: This is the content of the second footnote.
```
